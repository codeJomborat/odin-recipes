    <h1>Adobong Baboy ni Mama</h1>
    <img src="img/adobo.png" alt="Picture of Pork Adobo" width="300" height="400">
    <p> Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And I’ve got to say, it’s definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are other renditions of adobo. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1 kg pork belly or shoulder, cut into chunks</li>
    <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vinegar</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>1 whole garlic bulb, peeled and crushed</li>
    <li>2–3 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tsp whole black peppercorns</li>
    <li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp brown sugar (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps to make this yummy salad</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In a bowl, combine pork, soy sauce, half of the garlic, and peppercorns. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a pan. Sauté the remaining garlic until fragrant. Add the marinated pork and cook until browned.</li>
    <li>Pour in the saved marinade, vinegar, bay leaves, and water. Do not stir until the vinegar boils.</li>
    <li>Once boiling, reduce heat and cover. Let it simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the pork is tender. Stir occasionally.</li>
    <li>Add brown sugar if desired. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Optional: Uncover and simmer longer to reduce the sauce for a thicker consistency.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with steamed rice. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
